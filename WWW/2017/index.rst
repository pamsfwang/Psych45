Other than that which is genetically coded, everything we know is derived from and reflects memory for our past.
This course provides an introductory survey of the literature on learning and memory, including consideration of
the cognitive and neural organization of memory, mechanisms of remembering and forgetting, and the nature of
false memories. Cognitive theory and behavioral evidence will be integrated with data from patient studies and
functional brain imaging.
