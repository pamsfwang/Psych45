================

This is a collection of the assigned Memory in Action assignments for class.
Please follow the instructions to complete the demo, and enter your (brief!) responses directly into the text box for the assignment on Canvas.
As a reminder, responses must be uploaded to Canvas by no later than 24hrs prior to the date/lecture specified on the syllabus.


4/12: MiA #1: N-back
------------------------------------------------------
A classic n-back task can be found by navigating to `this page <http://cognitivefun.net/>`_ and then clicking on
the “Memory” tab and selecting "Working memory test (n-back)". Log in (in the left sidebar) using the
**username**: psych45 and **password**: stanford.

Start with a 2-back, then increase to the 3-back. Feel free to try the 4-back, etc.,
if you want! After you complete the demos, please answer the following questions and
submit your answers to these questions on Canvas **by no later than 9 AM on Weds (4/12)**.

#. What strategies did you use to try to remember the pictures? How well did they work?
#. How did the 2-back task compare to the 3-back (or 4-back, etc. if you tried it)?
#. How could you change the task to make it easier or harder, other than changing the number of targets (n)?

4/19: MiA #2: Stroop
------------------------------------------------------
A classic Stroop task can be found by navigating to `this page <http://cognitivefun.net/>`_ and then clicking on the “Executive” tab
and selecting Color Reading Interference (Stroop). Log in (in the left sidebar) using the *username*:
psych45 and *password*: stanford.
Complete the demo, and then  please answer the following questions and submit your answers to
these questions **by 9 AM on Weds 4/19**.

#. Were you as quick and accurate on all of the trials? Or were some trials easier than others? Why do you think this might be the case?
#. Did the task become easier over time?
#. Do you think the effect would be larger or smaller if, instead of identifying the color that color words were printed in, you were identifying the font that different font names were printed in? What about numbers in different font sizes? Explain your thinking.
#. Is there an example of the Stroop effect you've observed in the real world?

#. What type of encoding instructions were used? What type of memory test was used? Based on what we’ve learned about this type of memory test, what serial positions are you more likely to remember when performing this type of task?
#. How was your memory performance for the different types (positive, negative, neutral) of words? Why do you think this was the case? Did you use different encoding and/or retrieval strategies for the different types of words?
#. (Optional). Feel free to share any additional comments.
