4/12: MiA #1: N-back
------------------------------------------------------
A classic n-back task can be found by navigating to `this page <http://cognitivefun.net/>`_ and then clicking on
the “Memory” tab and selecting "Working memory test (n-back)". Log in (in the left sidebar) using the
**username**: psych45 and **password**: stanford.

Start with a 2-back, then increase to the 3-back. Feel free to try the 4-back, etc.,
if you want! After you complete the demos, please answer the following questions and
submit your answers to these questions on Canvas **by no later than 9 AM on Weds (4/12)**.

#. What strategies did you use to try to remember the pictures? How well did they work?
#. How did the 2-back task compare to the 3-back (or 4-back, etc. if you tried it)?
#. How could you change the task to make it easier or harder, other than changing the number of targets (n)?
