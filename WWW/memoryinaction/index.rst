5/19: MiA #4: Emotion & memory
------------------------------------------------------
Please complete the  demo and submit your answers to the questions below **by no later than 9 AM on Weds (5/18)**.



To complete the demo, we’d like you to use Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) if possible, so that we can collect data from the class, and share it during class time! However, if you choose not to use AMT, or have trouble getting AMT to work, see below for details about how to complete the demo using a separate URL.



A few things to note about using AMT:

- You will need an Amazon Worker account. You will be prompted for this when you click on the link.
- To start the demo you need to first click ‘accept HIT’
- If you get a message saying ‘Invalid URL’, just re-navigate to the URL and it should work.
- You can only start a given demo once in the AMT environment. So, please **do not start this demo until you are sure that you can finish it** (it should only take a few minutes). We have a separate URL (details below) that you can use if you’d like to view the demo again, but please be sure to complete the demo in the AMT environment your first time so that we can collect your data!
- It is strongly recommended that you run this demo using Chrome.
- Please let us know if you run into any trouble with the demo and we can try to fix it!


URLs:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To complete the demo through AMT, use this URL: https://workersandbox.mturk.com/mturk/preview?groupId=31SXY3N7KDXXERDBTZMVXOFT12T0BB

If you choose not to do the demo with AMT, have difficulty getting AMT to work, or just want to try the demo again, you can still do the demo at the following URL (we just can’t collect your data): http://web.stanford.edu/~sgagnon/emo/emo.html


Questions:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you’ve completed the demo, answer the following questions and make sure you submit your answers to these questions to Canvas **by no later than 9 AM on Weds (5/18)**.

#. What type of encoding instructions were used here? What type of memory test was used here? Based on what we’ve learned about this type of memory test, what serial positions are you more likely to remember when performing this type of task?
#. How was your memory performance for the different types (positive, negative, neutral) of words? Why do you think this was the case? Did you use different encoding and/or retrieval strategies for the different types of words?
#. (Optional). Feel free to share any additional comments.
