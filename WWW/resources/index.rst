Course Resources
================

This is a collection of resources that may be helpful for the course.


Visualizing The Brain
--------------------------------------------


`BrainVoyager Brain Tutor <http://www.brainvoyager.com/downloads/downloads.html>`_

- Must be downloaded (40 mbs for mac version)

- Basic tool for learning gross neuroanatomy



`Scalable Brain Atlas <http://scalablebrainatlas.incf.org/main/coronal3d.php?template=LPBA40_on_SRI24&>`_

- More advanced tool

- Allows viewers to 'see' specific regions across slices of the brain



`Neurosynth <http://neurosynth.org/>`_

- Meta analysis tool that allows users to view most commonly reported locations for given terms like 'memory' or 'cognitive control', or to view words most associated with activation in a region (these words tend to be either psychological constructs or anatomical labels)

- This is a fun tool, but remember that we are dealing with (possibly noisy) aggregation across studies
