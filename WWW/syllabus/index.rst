**Head TA**: Steph Gagnon

**Alternate Exams TA**: Kyle MacDonald

Course Requirements
--------------------------------------------

The course grade will be based on two midterms (each 25%), a cumulative final (25%), a written assignment
(15%), participation prompts (5%), and memory in action assignments (5%). You may receive up to 2 bonus points for peer assistance on Piazza.
**For the written assignment, students are asked to submit a 4-page (double-spaced) paper that
summarizes and critiques the accuracy of how memory is depicted in the movie Memento.** Guidelines for
the written assignment can be found below.


.. note:: Attending lectures is important because much of the material will be presented only in lectures. That is, lectures will not simply present the material from the text and readings in lecture format, but rather will focus on discussing complementary material.

Written Assignment: Memory in *Memento*
--------------------------------------------

**Due May 26, 2016, immediately after class**

For the written assignment, students are asked to submit a 4-page (double-spaced) paper that
summarizes and critiques the accuracy of how memory is depicted in the movie Memento. The objective of
the written assignment is to provide an opportunity for you to think actively and independently about the nature of
memory, as revealed through experimental research. Your assignment is to serve as a *memory expert* who has
been called upon to review the movie *Memento* (2000). Your task is to write a review of the movie that highlights
three characteristics of memory that are explicitly depicted in the film (Note: The movie depicts many more than
three characteristics of memory; you should choose the three that you would like to write about).

Importantly, for each of the three characteristics you discuss, you should:

- (i) describe the form of memory, the memory process, or the characteristic of memory that is depicted;

- (ii) critically evaluate whether the depiction is accurate or inaccurate, stating exactly what the director got right or wrong;

- (iii) provide experimental evidence from the literature discussed in class and/or in the readings that supports your evaluation.

The instructor and TAs will organize two opportunities to screen *Memento* (see dates on Schedule, below). If you cannot
attend either screening, then you should make arrangements to independently view the film. Stanford library has
three copies of the DVD that can be checked out, and the movie may also be available for streaming online.

.. note:: Late policy: Points will be taken off for late papers unless there is a medical emergency, in fairness to those who submit in a timely manner. Serious health or other issues that interfere with exam and assignment dates can be discussed with the Alternate Exams TA (Kyle MacDonald).

----------------

Participation Prompts
--------------------------------------------

During lecture, we will pose questions that are designed to prompt reflection on the nature or science of memory.
We will ask you to generate a brief written response that will be handed in at the end of the class.
Over the term, there will be 7 such prompts, and you will be asked to turn in 5.

.. note:: Late policy: There will be no opportunities for make-ups.

----------------

Memory in Action Demos
--------------------------------------------

We have assembled a series of memory demos that can be performed on-line.
Each demo will serve to illustrate a fundamental memory phenomenon and may also generate data from
the class that we can discuss during lecture. For each demo, we will also pose a question or two, to which
we ask that you provide brief responses (uploading your responses via Canvas).
MIA Demos should be completed and uploaded to Canvas 24hrs prior to the date/lecture specified on the syllabus.

.. note:: Late policy: Points will be taken off for late assignments unless there is a medical emergency, in fairness to those who submit in a timely manner. Serious health or other issues that interfere with assignment dates can be discussed with the Alternate Exams TA (Kyle MacDonald).

Optional Opportunities
--------------------------------------------

Memory at the Movies
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We will offer two supplemental Memory at the Movies events, during which we will
hold screenings of *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* and *Inside Out*. We will provide popcorn and
we will host a post-screening discussion of the memory-related issues raised in these movies.

Be the DJ
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Humans reflect on learning and memory in multiple forms of artist expression, from movies, to
books, to visual arts, to music. Drawing from the latter, just prior to each lecture we will play music that is
thematically related to the day’s topic. We are inviting you to be the DJ. Via Piazza, we welcome
suggestions for songs to play. Suggestions should arrive 48 hrs prior to the targeted lecture so as to
provide us an opportunity to pick the songs. We look forward to your input!

Extra Credit – Peer Assistance on Piazza (plus bonus, Retrieval Practice!)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We will use Piazza for on-line discussion of class content. We encourage students to field questions,
providing answers to posts from classmates. There are two benefits for students who consistently provide accurate,
thoughtful responses to posts—the potential for 2 bonus points to your grade, as well as the benefits of
engaging in retrieval practice which serves to foster learning and retention.
